# Configuration-Of-OSPF-Protocol
This PNETLab project demonstrates OSPF configuration across multiple routers. You can ping between router loopback interfaces without assigning IPs from a PC. It’s designed to practice OSPF routing and test connectivity directly between routers in a simulated network environment.
# OSPF Configuration Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) configuration across multiple routers in PNETLab. The network allows pinging between router loopback interfaces without assigning IPs from a PC. It’s designed for practicing OSPF routing and testing direct router-to-router connectivity.

## Features
- Multi-router OSPF setup
- Loopback-to-loopback ping testing
- Hands-on practice for network routing concepts

## How to Use
1. Download the topology and configuration files.
2. Load them into PNETLab.
3. Start the simulation and test connectivity between routers using ping commands.

## Prerequisites
- PNETLab (version [insert version])
- Basic knowledge of OSPF and routing concepts
